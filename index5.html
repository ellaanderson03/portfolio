  <h1>Disappointment or Disillusion</h1>
  <p>By Ella Anderson</p>
<p>
My home is an island and nobody really understands the idea except my neighbors, yes people know the tropical kind, the luxurious kind, but mine is distinct. It is a fisherman's kingdom and my safe haven. My home is isolated, my home is safe. </p>
<p>
Safety is an odd feeling for me as I witnessed the impact of the accidental things at a young age, it did not feel safe. My community surrounded me though, they brought food, and cards, donated flowers, the whole deal. That’s what people do when someone dies. But that’s not all, my community showered me with love and care, constantly caring and asking if we were okay, we were not, the home that had been planned perfectly was broken. My birth right idea of home, and the safety that it entails disappeared, and the fear of what is unknown washed over my impressionable young mind. Loss ensued a fear within me,  a fear of the unknown. The unknown being: who are you, what are you going to do with your time? A fear of disappointment and the inevitable failure that would be death.</p>
<p>
My house is in the middle of the island, not to the east or west ends but the center, it's a white house with dark green trim, we share a long dirt driveway with an old fishing family, and there's a tiny church up the street. My home is ingrained in not the house but the details, the rocks and trees, the noisy cars that have not been inspected. It’s very weird but also the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen. I am always asked by new people, “Do you like it?” “Is it hard.” Well I love it but I have not always, I would say it's a love hate relationship, it’s kept me stuck and sheltered, but also taught me everything I know about love and the beauty of simple things.</p> 
<p>
My childhood felt long, like I was older and wiser and wanted to tell everyone straight. Once I left my tiny school for a bigger world, I did not always feel the same. My high school is public, it’s big, and it's in the most populated city in Maine, which really is not saying much. It is one of the most diverse cities in Maine, unlike my sheltered island. There are different kinds of people wherever you look, Portland has a large immigrant population, but is also extremely expensive and a hub for rich business folks. Within the school, there are different society normatives, different cultures, people from all different backgrounds. I call it one of my homes because I feel that it has allowed me to grow, shown me that there's no better or worse background, there's happier, sadder, more devastating than imaginable, confusing, and a lot more. But inevitably no one is the same and that's fine. </p>
<p>
Homes grow and change, my school has changed, Maine is changing for the better, as Janet Mills became our first female governor this year. But I am still confused. I’m confused on what I want, who I am and how I want myself to change. I'm not sure if its my past trauma, my isolation of growing up in poverty but in a well off community, or the fact that my home is not who I am and wondering if that's just what every teenager feels like. Maybe it's me, but I don't want to be uneventful, and I don't want to be a disappointment. My life so far has lead me to believe that I can be who I want, fail and disappoint myself plenty, but I can find comfort in the idea that to my first home, I am just a sweet little kid who everyone wanted to save. </p>
