  Carelessly Indebted 
</h1>

<p>By Ella Anderson</p>
<p>
The rumbling engine wakes us up with the sun, down the street Stevie has revved his engine. My mom wakes and so do I, hearing the built in alarm clock I’ve become accustomed to. I sip the coffee and watch the Sunday Morning show, the one with the good stories, never the bantering kind. “Cody’s yards a mess” my mom announces as if it’s some new concept, and our young-adult neighbor of a man, is suddenly good at cleaning up after himself. </p>
<p>
It's Maine, Long Island. The hottest season has come and gone. The summer people only come for weekends to grab their nice sandals that they forgot and need for their next vacation. The kids are back on the roll that is the commute to school, and the lobstering months are dying down. </p>
<p>
Cody is here less and less, there's fewer parties to throw, and less lobsters to be caught, “maybe we’ll get some leftover scallops” my mom exclaims as she sees Craig and his son pull up the driveway. The locals are showing through, none of the older crowd has left for Florida quite yet. Sunday for me is filled with a strong force of homework I let persist till today, as yesterday I was at the Harvest Dinner, that rolls around each year to celebrate the fall. In a cozy room I see the faces of the people I am so connected to yet, completely different. I reconnect with my preschool buddies who I hardly see all summer, as they prefer to join the crowd of seasonal residents. I find it's hard because the seasonal kids don't quite get it, they see our beautiful summer landscape, but haven't seen the morning boat on the coldest day of the year, they may have gone to the funerals, but haven't been sitting next to the grieving kid in class, praying that some sort of topic will pop up to talk to them about, so you can see for yourself if they’re really okay. They aren't the fisherman, well neither am I, I’m the kid with the artsy parents, well parent, who wanted an alternative life experience. I’m not part of the 5th generation islander family. I still have a different view than them, I see the generations of fishing families, and yes I’m on the outside but I've heard their struggle. I watch the 5th generation kid in biology, hearing about the climate crisis and wondering what his future really is, or if the one being instilled in him since his first boat ride home from the hospital. I see him watch it breaking, yet falling into the pattern laid out for him. But, I also watch him stand by his friends, supporting some being who would disregard everything we learned in honors bio. How can those who need the environment to live, to keep on living, support people who wish to destroy it? Isn’t that just hypocrisy? Each blindingly indebted to a cycle set to end in less than a decade. </p>
<p>
My intention is not to tell you the story of these young men to deteriorate their livelihoods, their histories, for they seem to have no problem with the continuation of their predecessors' work. They have no issue with sitting on the porch with the lights blasted and a generic form of alcohol, wrapped in a Maine labeled cozy, sitting by their side. There is no problem, or at least they have chosen to disregard it, as Thomas Gray said, “ignorance is bliss.” And well that's true for my home. I believe I have chosen to say no to the addictive delight of not knowing. I choose to observe these men and see their qualities of good, that have continued through their community yet make a new set for myself. Continued the ideal of quintessential small town living, but there is something intriguing about the fact that a person would introduce their kids future to a dying practice, a dying art, and not show them how to reinvent it. </p>
<p>
My home is a dirt road so many know. The road of longing for something different for so long, that for many it has disappeared. Let us recognize the good parts of this island, the part that is a whole family, the part where everyone waves. So recognizing the sweet parts of my home, not everyone has become completely engulfed in the never ending cycle of no change. Some fall towards music, or raising sweet children, or growing kelp, or art. But it's the other falling pattern that is troublesome. </p>
<p>
New York: a beauty of collective appreciation for differences, the newfound experience I recently encountered, of being asked my pronouns. In my home it's different, and I’m not really for it, there's boys and girls, there's kids who learn that hunting and fishing is what they do, and once they're done with that it's a house and a wife. As Stanly Knick put it, “Culture of any kind works best (and longest) if it is well adapted to local conditions.” And that's true, my community has adapted to the local conditions, the surroundings that have never changed drastically, that are not changing currently, that I can't imagine will, except for the shore line. As the New York Times reporter Abby Nook got out of a Maine fisherman Clayton Fillbrook, from Matinicus a good long haul up the coast from my island home, “ If we lose control, we fold up and die — that’s it.” How striking that the man identifies with that struggle, the struggle that for generations his family has ignored. Although this interview stemmed from a mystery inquiry over a gunfight on who could fish where, to me it's comforting to know that someone sees the importance of being careful with the resources. </p>

Now, Cody, my friend from first period bio, Stevie, Craig, even the cool ones, they've got something ingrained in them I never have had: a sense of tradition. maybe I would have felt that if I was my cousin and my mother was an optometrist just like her father, and I attended the same claustrophobic high school every three generations of Whelans did. Maybe I would understand the need to maintain something of the past, in order to stay content, in order to feel no fear, and know nothing different, so that you can find joy in simplicity and not the complications of modern culture. Or would you just feel left out, disregarded from the party that is the want to change the future, the want to see something new, a fear that your generation could ruin something so special, that you feel the need to change it. Wouldn’t you just feel left out? I did, I felt like I was left out of the rest of the world, while I was growing with this community, that I must branch out to survive. I don't understand the want for sameness, like the fishermen of Maine, I understand them, the culture, but the unknowingness of what else could be their truth, well it baffles me. </p>
<p>
I hate to admit it, but I have made this sound quite worse than it is, I love my town, but inevitably they are buried in tradition, they are buried in the ideology that well I know somethings changing but maybe someone else will fix it and it'll all be fine. That idea can be one of comfort, one of the joys and one of the families, one of focussing on the life we live not the insanity our future prevails if we don't fix it. And well, maybe some people are meant to live their life like an island, made to live with bliss, because someone should, and well if all the plans for the future don't work out, at least some people will have lived with the joy that comes along with carelessness. </p>
