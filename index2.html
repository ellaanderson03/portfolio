    <h1>I Guess</h1>
    <p>By Ella Anderson</p>
    <p>
<p>
When you run down a hill, your momentum speeds up, you feel like you will never move this fast again, you can’t feel your legs anymore and you wonder what is coming, you feel all of the air just brushing by, but never reaching your face, you feel the people watching, but you are content there in your own freefall, in your undeniable clash as you reach the pit at the bottom, I’ve only ever felt that a few times before, like there was nothing I could do about the outcome, and I would still be okay.</p> 
<p>
Speeding up, around the middle, too fast, dashing down the dewy grass hill, “Don't unlink your arms” Sammie screamed at us, as everyone giggles without any control. We make it to the bottom but collapse because none of us ever let go and our legs are tangled up. My stomach aches, increasing a fear that I won't be able to breathe in a few more giggles, so I take in a breath with a massive sense of urgency. As I breathe, I allow myself to keep laughing, I feel like I’m weightless, and these girls around me are feeling the same way, I know they thought the same thing “I can’t breathe” and then we do and we see its safe to feel all this joy, safe to be happy, when the circumstances that brought us here were not, we are alive. </p>
<p>
We were alive. For me I feel most alive in the free moments, the ones where I’m jumping, moving so fast, that I know I could stumble at any moment; the roller coaster where you lose your breath for a second, or the edge of falling asleep where all knowingness gets blurred. It’s when I feel the consequences are actually possible, that I'm not so scared to die. When I see the end but try it anyways, when I let myself be fearless.</p>
<p>
That night we found safety in the fact that we were going back to the bunk, from camp fire, the end of my third year. After a night of burnt marshmallows, tears, laughs, and the goofy innuendos about our week at camp, we were headed back home. Back to our little home, the place we are all tied to because we all knew the saddest thing about each other. Our stories were different, but the weight of a past loss, is what connected us all. The weight we carry with us everywhere, that sometimes slips away, for a second, for a day, or maybe even two, then slides back, is what binds us to each other. It's the weight of the unknown, of the long waiting, of the inevitably known. When we ran down that hill, it was one of those times, one of the nights where everything was fine, and the circumstances of why we were all together, at a free camp for kids with one or more dead parents, that was gone. We were just friends, real ones, because we weren't scared of one anothers stories because they were practically our own, and we were different, but we knew one another enough to feel free.</p>
<p>
It doesn't sound that bad, or at least it sounds gross to me, maybe it sounds normal to you, or sad. My dad died when I was six, when I was about to head to the first week of first grade. I could not understand it then and I still don’t, I guess you could say, it was traumatic. We were at my grandmas, he was biking, mountain biking, I guess, and he flipped on a rock, and bam, it was gone. It being his life, being the life I had known. I do not know why, but the way I pictured it and put it down on paper for my therapist, was him taking a wrong turn and falling off a big tall bridge while slowly biking. What else was an accident, it was when you dropped a cookie you wanted to eat, or you skipped into a puddle that you didn't mean to. He was the cookie, he was the foot, death was the breaking, death was the splash. That's all I got from that day, I got a big splash, a big scream from my mom, a big dent in the person that clearly hadn't been formed yet. I was a kid who was confused, I was lost in the puddle, all murky, all sad. That day I took the blame, it was me in my head that made him go, that let him leave the playground we waited at, there must have been a reason that he fell off the bridge. </p>
<p>
My mom says I didn't do anything, I was struck. For the rest of the time I had to process, before going back to school. My mom said I just sat there in my room. I can picture it. I can picture me staring at the floor after being picked up from grandmas, and flown to Maine. I sat there. “That's what I did?” I asked my mom, “Really?” Well now I guess that must be true, I must have, because I remember getting little gifts and waking up to them left on my green wooden floor. A little butterfly in a little box from an aunt. Then more butterflies, on a dress, hanging on a necklace around my neck, for the big event, I loved that dress, its folded and hidden somewhere. A dress for a child, for a child to buy for a special occasion.</p>
<p>
It’s silly to me that my brain obsesses over my past, my life that isn't always in my mind. I'm not weird that much, I think a lot, too much, I think about how my mom yells I'm selfish, when I'm crying over how stressed out I have become, how she fights with me like I am the little sister she never had, like her older siblings did to her. She reminds me how good I have it, to have a mom who adores me, makes me food and clean. On this item I agree. I know I shouldn't, I know my pain is not selfish, but to me wallowing in it, and sharing the fact is selfish, it’s not fun for me, or for anyone else, and that’s why I never have, why I never share, it’s selfish to make others feel my pain, but still here I am indulging. </p>
<p>
It’s weird to get close to someone, weird to share stuff, because in my head the first thing about me is my dad is gone, and my mother is my savior, thats me, but it sure is not the only thing I am, and is not the thing I want people to know about me. Maybe its because its private, or maybe it's because the grief facilitators always asked us if we had ever been treated different by people whos dads and moms had not died. I never had been, until I knew that was actually a thing, and that’s pretty much when I figured out, that I wouldn’t talk about it with people who did not know already, or to the people who didn’t know who I was, but thought they did.</p>
<p>
I went to middle school and there were five people who knew that my dad was non-existent. He wasn't in my life, and I didn't need anyone to talk about that, five was enough for me. I didn't need anyone to tell me they were sorry, this being the most repetitive response I have had, followed by a continuation of my nervous laughter. </p>
<p>
I have gotten to be the kid who says sorry as well, a few too many times, my oldest friends have grown, lost and laughed to cope with the confusion. But that doesn’t mean I’ve been the kid who only got to say sorry, I’m the kid who’s prime jungle gym years were taken up by leaving early to go to therapy. I’m the kid who was scared of boats, and cars, and trains, and planes, and really any form of movement that could go ary. Especially the boat ride I had to take back and forth from therapy. </p>
<p>
My prime years of playing were kind of thrown off, and it’s as though I became a middle aged woman feeling all grown up and coming towards the end, if the experience of a death makes you grow up according to just about everyone, I have been counting my years since I was six. And well yes, I did grow too quick, dealt with too much too soon, but I also aged down, I became an infant all over, a new beginning. The new beginning I created for myself at six was, grow up as quick as you can, figure out life's goal by the time I was twenty, so I’d have a little more time for kids, a house and a husband. I bounced from interior designer, architect, engineer, lawyer, to writer? Kind of wacky I know, wacky, but that has been my evolution, my evolution from, that sounds fun at six to, I need money, I need to help others, and then maybe I should just be happy? Now it’s time to shift as we have already dived too far down into my brain’s life plan, Successful by 44.</p>
<p>
This ones about my new friends, the new wave I've had of being tired of being a fraud. It's about Steph and Neddie, and Charlee. One afternoon we decided to go to ihop. I hopped in my friends minivan things that rich moms drive, what are they called? Well I’m not sure but I think it was a rav4, and I get in the car, there's her brother, and Steph, Steph is a sweet lady, a classic suburbia kid, with a heart of gold, and a mindset of stability. A mindset that says, be a cheerleader forever, and live simply, where you can find joy, where you can take care of others, and die with content, in the same place you were born. Now Neddie, she was sitting next to her, Neddie’s a firecracker, she's got bright orange hair and a goofy laugh, when I met her I thought she was artsy, I thought she was fun and I saw the openness she possessed. Now Charlee wasn't there, but she's got brown hair, eyes of a baby grizzly bear who wants a hug, and a laugh that reminds me of the hill. Now we're driving to iHop, we get dropped off, oddly enough I spot my preschool teacher who had moved away a few years back, walking up the ramp, with her kid, who I met days after he was born, my name was his first word. This was before, before anything. These were my two worlds colliding at a center of cheap pancakes and bad coffee. I loved it, but I thought about how I would have loved it a few years back, with my friends who didn't know anything about me, confused as to which island I lived on, even though I would repeat it all the time. Knew nothing about my home life, except that I never spoke of a father. Back at iHop, my worlds were squishing together, Missy, the dance teacher, preschool teacher, the one who’s known me since I was an infant, both times I was an infant, never crying in her arms. I saw her, I saw my friends confused as to who this stranger was, I saw the duality of two lives intersecting, but it wasn't like the times before, shocked with the differences, shocked I’d never shared before, it was slick. Now after laughing alongside my friends and my preschool teacher, we split and each had some pancakes. Then we decided we wanted to go to the dollar store across the cement parkway, no sidewalk in sight, as the land of strip malls, walmarts, and cheap clothing spanned for miles of South Portland. We ran across the street in the break between fast moving minivans, I cussed the whole way with fear, laughing uncontrollably as I reached the other side of the four lane traffic. This was another one of those moments, a day that could have been bad, I had joy, I had fear, I thought I might die and it was funny as hell. </p>
<p>
The want for materialistic joy, swooped over my life, the second I stepped into King Middle. The second I saw the pretty blond girl with the perfect outfit, and glanced down at my water sandals, that I had begged my mom for when I saw them at goodwill. The feeling of displacement didn't appear right away, the first few weeks were pure bliss, everyone was friends, because no one knew anyone too much. But as time increased everything got worse, even though the picture of worse somewhat diminished, it never left my body, and might never, but I’m starting to grow out of it. </p>
<p>
Sadie, is the skinniest girl I've ever met, the girl I immensely wanted to be the first year of middle school, she was tiny and had the most beautiful, flawless, shiny, sleek, and picture worthy water bottle I had ever seen. This was one of those glass ones, the ones with the pastel colored rubber around the outside. I dreamed I would have that water bottle sitting on my desk, more than I ever dreamed to be her friend. Now, we were friends for a week, then comes Tyra, and now they're best friends, in an instant, I was just like excuse me, why don't you want to sit next to me anymore. I went through the list, and inevitably I believed it was because I was not as skinny as Sadie, and Tyra almost was. Oh well, I found someone else, I found Eleanor, I believe it was because we were grouped together in math, at the pretty smart kids table, but not quite the genius table. I think sometime in math we were making boards about our family, or they were hung up everywhere in the hall, or maybe had to add up our family members. Something insignificant enough to make me feel terrible, like, tell us about your life, and draw a little picture. Rows and rows of two parents, and two kids hung up on the tan felt walls, and there's mine, purple, with my mom and I, and a sentence below reading something along the lines of, “ I live on Long Island Maine with my mom, I had a fish once.” Eleanor was the only one who noticed, and asked me about it, she was like, “Do you have a dad?” and I was like “uuuh he passed away when I was little,” that response being almost as generic as the “Oh I’m sorry. How?” I got back from her. But it was fine, she was the only person I told until the next person asked a few years later. Now the funny part is, Sadie and Tyra stopped being friends and so did me and Eleanor. We all switched it up, we all changed, and the really strange part, by the end of eighth grade Tyra and Sadie were my best friends, so much so that there were birthday posts, they’d complain to me separately about one another, but oddly enough I don’t think I ever recalled to them that my father had died in a tragic biking accident when I was six. I never told that just for fun until Charlee, until we were having a sandwich after our teammate Antonia’s funeral service at school, until there was a common ground, of sadness, of confusion. Not because she asked, not because someone else told her, because I was comfortable with myself by now, I had lost enough friends for not being myself, and it wasn't even that bad, she did feel sorry for me though, I could see it in her cuddly bear eyes. </p>
<p>
Every time I've told someone, I've told my mom. I go home start talking about my day, and then say “I told blank about daddy today” and get back “Oh how was that” and usually I say “awkward.” She agrees saying that she never knows what to say that it's like how do I not make all these wives or divorced people not feel bad for complaining, not make them feel like bad friends, because my husbands dead, while also wishing they’d just stop complaining. One time she recounted a story about telling some random person on the boat ride home, that she had been chit chatting with. She had asked her about her family, and mom comes in with the response “Oh my husband actually passed away a few years ago” but this time it was different because the response wasn't “so sorry” it was “me too.” This ladies husband had died a few years ago, something similar to our story, but I don't remember the details. This is why my mom is better at communication than me, I guess because she is an adult. Because she doesn't scurry around the topic like its lava, and you really don't want to fall into it. She's point blank, she has me, she has a form of acceptance, acceptance because I don't think we believe closure is actually a thing, and she has grown more than I have, even if I don’t always want to believe that. She has a confidence I've always yearned for, and it’s lead her to make connections with random strangers, when I haven’t been able to share this with my closest friends. </p>
<p>I think Neddie was the first person who hasn't lost a parent, who didn't say sorry when I told her. I was telling her a deep story, and I included the sentence, “Wait, do you know that my dad died?” and she just said “Yeah I sorta thought that maybe, because you've never said anything about him” and I said “Yeah I never do.” And then I kept talking, like I was fine, like it was normal for me to share my story, like I was at ease with my selfishness. And let me tell you I was not. I don't know why it just makes every cell in my body squeeze up like a little dried tomato. Maybe that’s good enough. Maybe the feeling will never go away, and I guess that’s fine, as long as I let myself feel the weightlessness of exceleration, and find some form of joy in everything that was taken away from him, being able to find sensation in the fearless act of free falling. </p>
